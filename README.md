What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?

Business Problems Derived from the Data
Low Profit Margins on High Sales Categories: Categories or sub-categories with high sales but low profit margins might need a review of pricing strategy, cost management, or discount policies.

Ineffective Discounts: Discounts that do not result in a proportional increase in sales volume might need to be re-evaluated. Discounts should drive enough sales to justify the reduced profit margin.

Regional Discrepancies: Regions with lower sales and profits compared to others might benefit from targeted marketing efforts, promotions, or understanding regional preferences better.

Inventory Management: Products with low sales and high inventory could indicate overstocking issues, leading to high holding costs. Conversely, products frequently out of stock might indicate lost sales opportunities.

Customer Segmentation and Targeting: Identifying high-value customers (e.g., through purchase frequency and order value) can help tailor marketing strategies and retention efforts to maximize revenue from these segments.

Underperforming States: States with consistently lower performance might require more localized strategies to boost sales and profit, such as region-specific promotions or partnerships.

Product Portfolio Optimization: Products or sub-categories with consistently poor performance might need to be discontinued or redesigned, while investing more in top-performing products.

Operational Efficiency: Analyzing the cost and efficiency of order fulfillment and shipping can highlight areas for operational improvement, reducing costs and improving customer satisfaction.

By addressing these issues, a business can work on areas that need improvement to increase overall profitability and efficiency.
